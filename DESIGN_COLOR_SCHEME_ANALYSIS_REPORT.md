### 2.3 Areas for Improvement

⚠️ **Concerns & Issues:**

   - WCAG AA compliance may be compromised in certain contexts
   - Color-dependent information may be inaccessible to colorblind users

2. **Market Alignment:**
   - Very bright neon pink may be perceived as too playful/immature for fashion retail
   - May not convey the sophistication and trust required for e-commerce transactions
   - Could potentially alienate older demographics (Millennials, Gen X)

3. **Visual Fatigue:**
   - Extensive use of bright magenta throughout the interface may cause visual fatigue
   - Lack of color hierarchy - everything is equally emphasized
   - May compete with product imagery for attention

4. **Brand Perception:**

   - Could be perceived as "tech startup" rather than "fashion platform"
   - May not convey luxury or premium quality

5. **Color Psychology:**
   - While pink/magenta can convey creativity and innovation, it may not strongly convey trust and reliability
